# FarmChain
FarmChain is a digital produce traceability and inventory system designed for Kenyan smallholder farmers and cooperatives. It helps farmers log harvests, manage storage, and track sales, while enabling buyers (local markets, exporters, and cooperatives) to verify produce authenticity and source by scanning QR codes.
